# Mini-Win Tracker

This is a Python script that asks me one question each day:

"What is one thing you did today that you're proud of?"

It saves my answer and the date to a CSV file called `mini_win_log.csv`.

---

## How to Use

1. Activate the virtual environment:
   ```
   source venv/Scripts/activate
   ```

2. Run the script:
   ```
   python main.py
   ```

A new entry will be added to the CSV file every time it's run.

## Expansion Plans

I may add more questions, daily quotes, or graphs to see my progress over time.
